# DeathsAdvance

DeathsAdvance is very simply a plugin created to use your DK's level 58 talent "Death's Advance" buff as much as possible while running around both IN COMBAT and OUT OF COMBAT. 

It's designed to only cast Death's Advance when the DK is moving and has the talent.

It will not cast Death's Advance while casting, while mounted (mount, transport or taxi), another speed buff is active, or your while your DK is dead.

Death's Advance should not conflict with any Combat Routine.
